# Payroll Java Template

## Overview
This is a Java console application template for creating a Payroll Calculator. The project uses Gradle as the build system and is designed as a learning lab for computer science students.

## Project Architecture
- **Language**: Java 19 (GraalVM)
- **Build System**: Gradle 8.10.2
- **Project Structure**: Multi-module Gradle project
- **Main Module**: `app/` containing the Java source code
- **Main Class**: `org.example.App`
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Guava 33.2.1-jre (Google's Java utilities)
  - JUnit Jupiter 5.10.3 (for testing)

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Java environment configured and working
- ‚úÖ Gradle build system functional
- ‚úÖ Console application workflow set up
- ‚úÖ Basic application structure in place
- üìù Ready for payroll calculator implementation

## Recent Changes
- **2025-09-14**: Initial project setup in Replit environment
  - Updated Java toolchain from version 21 to 19 to match available runtime
  - Configured Gradle build to work with GraalVM 19
  - Set up workflow for console application execution
  - Verified build and run processes work correctly

## Development Commands
- **Build**: `./gradlew build`
- **Test**: `./gradlew test`
- **Run**: `./gradlew run --quiet --console=plain`

## Workflow Configuration
- **Name**: Payroll Console App
- **Command**: `./gradlew run --quiet --console=plain`
- **Type**: Console application (exits after execution)

## User Preferences
- Template project - no specific user preferences established yet
- Standard Java coding conventions expected
- Gradle-based development workflow preferred

## Next Steps
This is a template project ready for students to implement their payroll calculator logic. The main application code should be added to `App.java` or new classes as needed within the `org.example` package.
